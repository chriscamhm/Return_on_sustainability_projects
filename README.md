# Return_on_sustainability_projects
This repository is for a project in my job to determine the financial return of social investment projects.

The general objective was to develop and implement a standard methodology that allows Ecopetrol to quantify the return on its investments in sustainability. An initial project was based on the Return on Sustainability Investment methodology by New York University and applied in an oil field called Castilla in the east of Colombia
